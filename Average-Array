#setup and array and add data
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#Declare my varables
summ = 0
count = 0

#Have Python go through the array.  Look at count,  as you can see I set it to 0 before.  So this will look at the array starting at 0
#So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, Then it will add one to count as long as there is still uncounted data in the array.  Then it will add the data in the array.  
#
for number in numbers:
    sum += number
    count += 1

#Now I have added another varable average.  This will get the average from the data in the array
average = summ / count

#show all of the data. 
print("the avg of the elements in the array is", average)
